# Cat2d (aka LÃ¶ve 2D sandbox experiment)

### Sandbox

This is supposed to be a 2d adventure game of some kind, involving cats.  That's what I told myself, and my daughter, at any rate.

So far it's a sandbox where I'm learning how to write a game in Lua for Mac OS X and iOS, having:

- Graphics
- Sounds
- Touch
- Accelerometer
- UDP networking

### Running on OS X

- See the [Love2d Getting Started docs](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and make s
  - I recommend setting a bash alias like this: `alias love='/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love'`
- From the project root, run: `love cat2d.love`

### Running on iOS

- Xcode project: ios/platform/xcode/love.xcodeproj

I'm not able to run love2d stuff in any of the simulators; I always test on an iPad or iPhone physical device.
